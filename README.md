Hello there,
I'm Yunus.

I programmed this application for private use and it is for commercial purposes. Therefore, this is not open-source.
Because of this, I am not allowed (at the moment) to share my source code publicly. If in the future, the conditions change,
I will surely make it open-source.

You will find a video of the program running in order to give you an idea of what it does and the technologies it uses.

I've programmed this Java Swing application to make it simpler and faster to manage KepServerEX. Including IoT Gateway connections, it includes a configuration API client. Some extra functions are present, which include direct communication with an excel file for saving connection credentials for faster server switching and saving program logs with just a click into your folder.

Thanks,

-Yunus Emre Vurgun
