Hello there,
I'm Yunus.

I programmed this application for private use and it is for commercial purposes. Therefore, this is not open-source.
Because of this, I am not allowed (at the moment) to share my source code publicly. If in the future, the conditions change,
I will surely make it open-source.

You will find a video of the program running in order to give you an idea of what it does and the technologies it uses.

Thanks,

-Yunus Emre Vurgun
